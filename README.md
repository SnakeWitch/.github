# 🧙‍♀️ SnakeWitch  

**SnakeWitch** is a **grimoire of lightweight snake-keeping tools** — quick utilities, integrations, and experiments that make husbandry a little easier (and a little more magical).  

Where [CatholicMedusa](https://github.com/CatholicMedusa) focuses on **ecosystem-level apps** (trackers, genetics engines, CV/IoT), SnakeWitch is about **small spells**: spreadsheets, calculators, scripts, and micro-helpers.
